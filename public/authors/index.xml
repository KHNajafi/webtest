      <description>&lt;p&gt;Khalil H Najafi is formally a data scientist, from the domains of econometrics and applied statistics.  His approach is very much grounded in the scientific method, focusing on generating and prioritizing the right questions $ [problem^{forward} &amp;gt; solution_{backward}] $ then analyzing all relevant data (including qualitative factors) to evaluate hypotheses, and most importantly, begin the process of creating knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of speaking in the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; person, I am a huge fan of Batman, hats, football (as in &lt;em&gt;football&lt;/em&gt; football; go City), and most of all, my wife &amp;amp; two bambinos :)&lt;/p&gt;
