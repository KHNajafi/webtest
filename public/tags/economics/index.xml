&lt;p&gt;Snippet of the menu for an (intentionally) anonymous sushi restaurant in Toronto, and all I can think is: &lt;strong&gt;A literal tax on happiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of a course I took in &lt;em&gt;Economics of Public Finance&lt;/em&gt;, specifically on the subtopic of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax&#34;&gt;Pigouvian taxes&lt;/a&gt; — essentially a tax placed on activities that create negative costs to others: an entrepreneur may wish to build a factory next to a residential area and a whole host of ‘costs’ may arise which the firm does not pay directly, such as unpleasant fumes causing perma-smelly-backyards for nearby residents (more generally, a negative externality). To discourage or lead to a more desirable (efficient) outcome, there may be taxes levied on the factory owners, perhaps to provide residents with a lifetime supply of &lt;em&gt;Febreze&lt;/em&gt;. I feel as if this restauranteur may view joy as a negative thing, so to offset the happiness of friends congregating to celebrate we all need to pay a $1 tax .. don’t turn that frown upside down, please.&lt;/p&gt;
